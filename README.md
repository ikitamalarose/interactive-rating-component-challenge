## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

```css
background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #232a34 0%, #181e27 100%);
```
- I explored the use of CSS gradients to create visually appealing backgrounds. This specific linear gradient creates a smooth transition from a dark blue-gray color (#232a34) at the top to a slightly darker shade (#181e27) at the bottom. Gradients are a great way to add depth and professionalism to a design without the need for multiple images or extra assets.
